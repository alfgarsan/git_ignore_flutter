The .gitignore file in this project is a typical .gitignore file for a flutter project.

So the remaining content, I mean, the content that is actually managed by git should be something llike that:
* android
* ios
* lib
* web
* other user content folders for example like:  sounds, etc
* .gitignore
* .metadata
* pubspec.yaml
* README.md
